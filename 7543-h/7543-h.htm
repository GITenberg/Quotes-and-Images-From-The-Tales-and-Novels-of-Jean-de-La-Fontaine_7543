      LIFE OF
    </h2>
    <h2>
      <a name="FONTAINE_LIFE" id="FONTAINE_LIFE"></a>JEAN DE LA FONTAINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean de La Fontaine was born on the 8th of July, 1621, at Chateau-Thierry,
      and his family held a respectable position there.
    </p>
    <p>
      His education was neglected, but he had received that genius which makes
      amends for all. While still young the tedium of society led him into
      retirement, from which a taste for independence afterwards withdrew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the age of twenty-two, when a few sounds from the lyre of
      Malherbe, heard by accident, awoke in him the muse which slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon became acquainted with the best models: Phoedrus, Virgil, Horace
      and Terence amongst the Latins; Plutarch, Homer and Plato, amongst the
      Greeks; Rabelais, Marot and d'Urfe, amongst the French; Tasso, Ariosto and
      Boccaccio, amongst the Italians.
    </p>
    <p>
      He married, in compliance with the wishes of his family, a beautiful,
      witty and chaste woman, who drove him to despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sought after and cherished by all distinguished men of letters. But
      it was two Ladies who kept him from experiencing the pangs of poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Fontaine, if there remain anything of thee, and if it be permitted to
      thee for a moment to soar above all time; see the names of La Sabliere and
      of Hervard pass with thine to the ages to come!
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of La Fontaine was, so to speak, only one of continual
      distraction. In the midst of society, he was absent from it. Regarded
      almost as an imbecile by the crowd, this clever author, this amiable man,
      only permitted himself to be seen at intervals and by friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had few books and few friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst a large number of works that he has left, everyone knows his
      fables and his tales, and the circumstances of his life are written in a
      hundred places.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died on the 16th of March, 1695.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Joseph, by the side of Moliere.

      <a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE
    </h2>
    <h2>
      TO THE FIRST VOLUME OF THESE TALES
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I had resolved not to consent to the printing of these Tales, until after
      I had joined to them those of Boccaccio, which are those most to my taste;
      but several persons have advised me to produce at once what I have
      remaining of these trifles, in order to prevent from cooling the curiosity
      to see them, which is still in its first ardour. I gave way to this advice
      without much difficulty, and I have thought well to profit by the
      occasion. Not only is that permitted me, but it would be vanity on my part
      to despise such an advantage........... Now, that I should be permitted to
      write about these as so many others have done and with success I do not
      believe it can be doubted; and people cannot condemn me for so doing,
      without also condemning Ariosto before me and the Ancients before Ariosto.
      It may be said that I should have done better to have suppressed certain
      details, or at least to have disguised them. Nothing was more easy, but it
      would have weakened the tale and taken away some of its charm: So much
      circumspection is only necessary in works which promise great discretion
      from the beginning, either by their subject or by the manner in which they
      are treated. I confess that it is necessary to keep within certain limits,
      and that the narrowest are the best; also it must be allowed me that to be
      too scrupulous would spoil all. He who would wish to reduce Boccaccio to
      the same modesty as Virgil, would assuredly produce nothing worth having,
      and would sin against the laws of propriety by setting himself the task to
      observe them. For in order that one may not make a mistake in matters of
      verse and prose, extreme modesty and propriety are two very different
      things. Cicero makes the latter consist in saying what is appropriate one
      should say, considering the place, the time, and the persons to whom one
      is speaking. This principle once admitted, it is not a fault of judgment
      to entertain the people of to-day with Tales which are a little broad.

        BOCCACE alone is not my only source;
      </p>
      <p>
        T'another shop I now shall have recourse;
      </p>
      <p>
        Though, certainly, this famed Italian wit
      </p>
      <p>
        Has many stories for my purpose fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        But since of diff'rent dishes we should taste;
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon an ancient work my hands I've placed;
      </p>
      <p>
        Where full a hundred narratives are told,
      </p>
      <p>
        And various characters we may behold;
      </p>
      <p>
        From life, Navarre's fair queen the fact relates;
      </p>
      <p>
        My story int'rest in her page creates;
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond dispute from her we always find,
      </p>
      <p>
        Simplicity with striking art combin'd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, whether 'tis the queen who writes, or not;
      </p>
      <p>
        I shall, as usual, here and there allot
      </p>
      <p>
        Whate'er additions requisite appear;
      </p>
      <p>
        Without such license I'd not persevere,
      </p>
      <p>
        But quit, at once, narrations of the sort;
      </p>
      <p>
        Some may be long, though others are too short. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        LET us proceed, howe'er (our plan explained:)
      </p>
      <p>
        A pretty servant-girl a man retain'd.
      </p>
      <p>
        She pleas'd his eye, and presently he thought,
      </p>
      <p>
        With ease she might to am'rous sports be brought;
      </p>
      <p>
        He prov'd not wrong; the wench was blithe and gay,
      </p>
      <p>
        A buxom lass, most able ev'ry way. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        AT dawn, one summer's morn, the spark was led
      </p>
      <p>
        To rise, and leave his wife asleep in bed;
      </p>
      <p>
        He sought at once the garden, where he found
      </p>
      <p>
        The servant-girl collecting flow'rs around,
      </p>
      <p>
        To make a nosegay for his better half,
      </p>
      <p>
        Whose birth-day 'twas:&mdash;he soon began to laugh,
      </p>
      <p>
        And while the ranging of the flow'rs he prais'd,
      </p>
      <p>
        The servant's neckerchief he slyly rais'd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who, suddenly, on feeling of the hand,
      </p>
      <p>
        Resistance feign'd, and seem'd to make a stand;
      </p>
      <p>
        But since these liberties were nothing new,
      </p>
      <p>
        They other fun and frolicks would pursue;
      </p>
      <p>
        The nosegay at the fond gallant was thrown;
      </p>
      <p>
        The flow'rs he kiss'd, and now more ardent grown
      </p>
      <p>
        They romp'd and rattl'd, play'd and skipt around;
      </p>
      <p>
        At length the fair one fell upon the ground;
      </p>
      <p>
        Our am'rous spark advantage took of this,
      </p>
      <p>
        And nothing with the couple seem'd amiss. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        UNLUCKILY, a neighbour's prying eyes
      </p>
      <p>
        Beheld their playful pranks with great surprise,
      </p>
      <p>
        She, from her window, could the scene o'erlook;
      </p>
      <p>
        When this the fond gallant observ'd, he shook;
      </p>
      <p>
        Said he, by heav'ns! our frolicking is seen,
      </p>
      <p>
        By that old haggard, envious, prying quean;
      </p>
      <p>
        But do not heed it; instantly he chose
      </p>
      <p>
        To run and wake his wife, who quickly rose;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        So much the dame he fondl'd and caress'd,
      </p>
      <p>
        The garden walk she took at his request,
      </p>
      <p>
        To have a nosegay, where he play'd anew
      </p>
      <p>
        Pranks just the same as those of recent view,
      </p>
      <p>
        Which highly gratified our lady fair,
      </p>
      <p>
        Who felt dispos'd, and would at eve repair,
      </p>
      <p>
        To her good neighbour, whom she bursting found,
      </p>
      <p>
        With what she'd seen that morn upon the ground. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        THE usual greetings o'er, our envious dame,
      </p>
      <p>
        With scowling brow exclaim'd,&mdash;my dear, your fame,
      </p>
      <p>
        I love too much not fully to detail,
      </p>
      <p>
        What I have witnessed, and with truth bewail;
      </p>
      <p>
        Will you continue, in your house to keep
      </p>
      <p>
        A girl, whose conduct almost makes me weep?
      </p>
      <p>
        Anon I'd kick her from your house, I say;
      </p>
      <p>
        The strumpet should not stay another day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wife replied, you surely are deceiv'd;
      </p>
      <p>
        An honest, virtuous creature she's believ'd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I can easily, my friend, suppose,
      </p>
      <p>
        Rejoin'd the neighbour, whence this favour flows;
      </p>
      <p>
        But look about, and be convinc'd, this morn
      </p>
      <p>
        From my own window (true as you are born,)
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the garden I your husband spi'd
      </p>
      <p>
        And presently the servant girl I ey'd;
      </p>
      <p>
        At one another various flow'rs they threw,
      </p>
      <p>
        And then the minx a little graver grew.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand you, cried the list'ning fair;
      </p>
      <p>
        You are deceiv'd:&mdash;myself alone was there. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        NEIGHBOUR <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But patience, if you please: attend I pray
      </p>
      <p>
        You've no conception what I meant to say:
      </p>
      <p>
        The playful fair was actively employ'd,
      </p>
      <p>
        In plucking am'rous flow'rs&mdash;they kiss'd and toy'd. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        WIFE <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        'Twas clearly I, howe'er, for her you took. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        NEIGHBOUR <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The flow'rs for bosoms quickly they forsook;
      </p>
      <p>
        Large handfuls frequently they seem'd to grasp,
      </p>
      <p>
        And ev'ry beauty in its turn to clasp. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        WIFE <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But still, why think you, friend, it was not I?
      </p>
      <p>
        Has not your spouse with you a right to try
      </p>
      <p>
        What freaks he likes? <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        NEIGHBOUR <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But then, upon the ground
      </p>
      <p>
        This girl was thrown, and never cried nor frown'd;
      </p>
      <p>
        You laugh.&mdash; <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        WIFE <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed I do, 'twas myself. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        NEIGHBOUR <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A flannel petticoat display'd the elf. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        WIFE <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>

        Be patient:&mdash;and inform me, pray,
      </p>
      <p>
        If this were worn by you or her to-day?
      </p>
      <p>
        There lies the point, for, if you'll me believe,
      </p>
      <p>
        Your husband did&mdash;the most you can conceive. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        WIFE <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        NEIGHBOUR <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh! that's conclusive; I'll be silent now;

      <p>
        Though truly I am led to think, my eyes
      </p>
      <p>
        Are pretty sharp, and much I feel surprise
      </p>
      <p>
        At what you say; in fact, I would have sworn,
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw them thus at romps this very morn;
      </p>
      <p>
        Excuse the hint, and do not turn her off. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        WIFE <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Why, turn her off?&mdash;the very thought I scoff;
      </p>
      <p>
        She serves me well. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        NEIGHBOUR <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        And so it seems is taught;
      </p>
      <p>
        By all means keep her then, since thus she's thought.

        WHO knows the world will never feel surprise,

        When men are duped by artful women's eves;
      </p>
      <p>
        Though death his weapon freely will unfold;
      </p>
      <p>
        Love's pranks, we find, are ever ruled by gold.

      <p>
        To vain coquettes I doubtless here allude;
      </p>
      <p>
        But spite of arts with which they're oft endued;

      <p>
        I hope to show (our honour to maintain,)
      </p>
      <p>
        We can, among a hundred of the train,
      </p>
      <p>
        Catch one at least, and play some cunning trick:&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, take blithe Gulphar's wily nick,
      </p>
      <p>
        Who gained (old soldier-like) his ardent aim,
      </p>
      <p>
        And gratis got an avaricious dame. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        LOOK well at this, ye heroes of the sword,
      </p>
      <p>
        Howe'er with wily freaks your heads be stored,
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond a doubt, at court I now could find,
      </p>
      <p>
        A host of lovers of the Gulphar kind. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        To Gasperin's so often went our wight,
      </p>
      <p>
        The wife at length became his sole delight,
      </p>
      <p>
        Whose youth and beauty were by all confessed;
      </p>
      <p>
        But, 'midst these charms, such av'rice she possessed,
      </p>
      <p>
        The warmest love was checked&mdash;a thing not rare,
      </p>
      <p>
        In modern times at least, among the FAIR.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Tis true, as I've already said, with such
      </p>
      <p>
        Sighs naught avail, and promises not much;
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a purse, who wishes should express,
      </p>
      <p>
        Would vainly hope to gain a soft caress.
      </p>
      <p>
        The god of love no other charm employs,
      </p>
      <p>
        Then cards, and dress, and pleasure's cheering joys;
      </p>
      <p>
        From whose gay shops more cuckolds we behold,
      </p>
      <p>
        Than heroes sallied from Troy's horse of old. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        BUT to our lady's humour let's adhere;
      </p>
      <p>
        Sighs passed for naught: they entered not her ear;
      </p>
      <p>
        'Twas speaking only would the charmer please,
      </p>
      <p>
        The reader, without doubt, my meaning sees;
      </p>
      <p>
        Gay Gulphar plainly spoke, and named a sum
      </p>
      <p>
        A hundred pounds, she listened:&mdash;was o'ercome. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        OUR wight the cash by Gasperin was lent;
      </p>
      <p>
        And then the husband to the country went,
      </p>
      <p>
        Without suspecting that his loving mate,
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed with horns to ornament his pate. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        THE money artful Gulphar gave the dame,
      </p>
      <p>
        While friends were round who could observe the same;
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, said the spark, a hundred pounds receive,
      </p>
      <p>
        'Tis for your spouse:&mdash;the cash with you I leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lady fancied what the swain had said,
      </p>
      <p>
        Was policy, and to concealment led. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        NEXT morn our belle regaled the arch gallant,
      </p>
      <p>
        Fulfilled his promise:&mdash;and his eager want.
      </p>
      <p>
        Day after day he followed up the game;
      </p>
      <p>
        For cash he took, and int'rest on the same;
      </p>
      <p>
        Good payers get, we always may conclude,
      </p>
      <p>
        Full measure served, whatever is pursued. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        WHEN Gasperin returned, our crafty wight,
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the wife addressed her spouse at sight;
      </p>
      <p>
        Said he the cash I've to your lady paid,
      </p>
      <p>
        Not having (as I feared) required its aid;
      </p>
      <p>
        To save mistakes, pray cross it in your book;
      </p>
      <p>
        The lady, thunderstruck, with terror shook;
      </p>
      <p>
        Allowed the payment; 'twas a case too clear;
      </p>
      <p>
        In truth for character she 'gan to fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        But most howe'er she grudged the surplus joy,
      </p>
      <p>
        Bestowed on such a vile, deceitful boy. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        THE loss was doubtless great in ev'ry view
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the town the wicked Gulphar flew;
      </p>
      <p>
        In all the streets, at every house to tell,
      </p>
      <p>
        How nicely he had trick'd the greedy belle. <br /><br /><br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        To blame him useless 'twere you must allow;
      </p>
      <p>
        The French such frolicks readily avow.

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
